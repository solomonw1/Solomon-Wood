# Hi, I'm Solomon

I have started working on a proper Monterey Patcher UI for Ben Sova's Mini Monterey.
The main reason for this is that there is currently no native patcher UI, when there
should be. I understand that Ben Sova will definitely not be writing a Patched 
Monterey. I will start work this afternoon (possibly, if I have time). You should
expect a full version out in a few weeks.

It's not going to be terrible like last time. 

**Note**, at around Christmas and for a month afterwards, I will not be able to work on
this for an unrelated personal reason.
